This is my code and related documents for my MA 615 final project. background.png and background1.png are used when generated p1 and p2(just
to have some fun). 
Please make sure to put all the files in the same directoty. Word clouds take certain time to fully generated. Again this is an very interesting
course and I truly have explored a lot! Thank you Professor Haviland.

Regards,
